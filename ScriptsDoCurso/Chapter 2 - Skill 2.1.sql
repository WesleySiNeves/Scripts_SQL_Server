-- Correlated subqueries
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- products with minimum unitprice per category

-- Optimization of subqueries versus joins
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- compute for each order the percent of the current freight value
-- out of customer total, and difference from average

-- index to support queries
CREATE INDEX idx_cid_i_frt_oid
  ON Sales.Orders(custid) INCLUDE(freight, orderid);

-- Each subquery involves separate access to data
SELECT orderid, custid, freight,
  freight / ( SELECT SUM(O2.freight)
              FROM Sales.Orders AS O2
              WHERE O2.custid = O1.custid ) AS pctcust,

              FROM Sales.Orders AS O3
              WHERE O3.custid = O1.custid ) AS diffavgcust
FROM Sales.Orders AS O1;

-- With join only one access to data to compute all aggregates
SELECT O.orderid, O.custid, O.freight,
  freight / totalfreight AS pctcust,
  freight - avgfreight AS diffavgcust
FROM Sales.Orders AS O
  INNER JOIN ( SELECT custid, SUM(freight) AS totalfreight, AVG(freight) AS avgfreight
               FROM Sales.Orders
               GROUP BY custid ) AS A
    ON O.custid = A.custid;

-- remove index
DROP INDEX idx_cid_i_frt_oid ON Sales.Orders;

-- identify shippers who didn't handle any orders yet

-- add row
INSERT INTO Sales.Shippers(companyname, phone)
  VALUES('Shipper XYZ', '(123) 456-7890');

-- with subquery
SELECT S.shipperid

-- Delete new shipper row

-- The APPLY operator
---------------------------------------------------------------------
